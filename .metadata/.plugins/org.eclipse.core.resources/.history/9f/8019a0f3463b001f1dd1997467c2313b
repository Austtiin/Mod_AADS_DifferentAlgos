 * 
 * Write a Java program that outputs a multiplication table for numbers between 1 and 10. 
 * The value k for a specific run should be solicited from the user. 
 * Implement both the iterative and recursive approaches. 
 * Perform a test on the two algorithms using a low bound of k =1, 
 * median k = 5, and upper bound k = 10, 20, 50, and 100. and report on your 
 * performance (milliseconds) findings on these two algorithms 
 * (iterative and recursive).

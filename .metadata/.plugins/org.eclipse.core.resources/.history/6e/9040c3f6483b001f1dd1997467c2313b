 *
 * Write a Java program that outputs a multiplication table for numbers between 1 and 10.
 * The value k for a specific run should be solicited from the user.
 * Implement both the iterative and recursive approaches.
 * Perform a test on the two algorithms using a low bound of k =1,
 * median k = 5, and upper bound k = 10, 20, 50, and 100. and report on your
 * performance (milliseconds) findings on these two algorithms
 * (iterative and recursive).
